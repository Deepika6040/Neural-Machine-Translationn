During the training process, the NMT model learns to map a source sentence to its target translation by optimizing a loss function, such as cross-entropy loss. This is done by comparing the predicted translation to the reference translation and adjusting the model's parameters accordingly using gradient descent optimization.

One of the key advantages of NMT is its ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information, which allows for more accurate and fluent translations. Additionally, NMT models have the potential to generalize well to unseen phrases or sentence structures.

NMT systems have been successfully applied to various language pairs, including pairs with limited resources or low-resource languages. However, NMT still faces challenges such as handling rare words, translating ambiguous words or phrases, and maintaining consistency throughout the translation.

Overall, NMT has significantly advanced the field of machine translation and continues to be an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to improve its performance, address its limitations, and explore new techniques such as multilingual and zero-shot translation.
